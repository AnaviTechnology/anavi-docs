## Assembly

You can assemble ANAVI Light pHAT and mount it on your Raspberry Pi with your bare hands and a screw driver following the steps below:

* Ensure that you Raspberry Pi is compatible with ANAVI Light pHAT.
* Power off your Raspberry Pi.
* Gently mount ANAVI Light pHAT on the 40 pin header of your Raspberry Pi.
* Using a screw driver connect 12V RGB LED strip to the terminal blocks.
* Add sensors to your ANAVI Light pHAT.
* Use 12V power supply with 2.1x.5.5 DC jack for powering the RGB LED strip and 5V USB power supply for the Raspberry Pi.
* Optionally, you may also mount two or four brass M2.5 standoffs to keep your Pi HAT snug on your Raspberry Pi while also keeping the two boards separated.
* That's all, now you are ready to go!

## Powering ANAVI Light pHAT

ANAVI Light pHAT requires two power supplies:

* 12V power supply for the RGB LED strip
* 5V power supply for the Raspberry Pi


ANAVI Light pHAT has been tested using 12V power supplies from SUNNY Computer Technology Europe such as [SYS1530-1212-W2E](https://www.sunny-euro.com/en/products/sys1530-1212-w2e-europe-2-1x5-5x11-s-2wc-1-4m-4-5ft). The output current depends on the leght of the RGB LED strip and the number of LEDs in it. ANAVI Light pHAT has been tested with power supplies with output current in the range from 1A to 5A. Using power supplies and RGB LED stip that requires higher output current than 5A is not recommended. Make sure that you are using a 12V power supply from a trusted supplier. Cheap, untested power supplies can be risky and unreliable.

It is recommended to use the [official Raspberry Pi Power Supply](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/universal-power-supply/) or another 2.5A USB power supply from reputable retailer to power the Raspberry Pi.

## Device Tree Overlays

Device Tree (DT) in Linux is a description of the hardware in a system. The DT overlay adds a number of optional elements.

The EEPROM of ANAVI Light pHAT contains DT overlay with description of the peripheral devices on the HAT. After adding Anavi to your Raspberry Pi and booting it you  should have some new filesystem nodes at */proc/device-tree/hat*:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls -l /proc/device-tree/hat/
total 0
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  4 Feb 15 00:27 name
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 20 Feb 15 00:27 product
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  7 Feb 15 00:27 product_id
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  7 Feb 15 00:27 product_ver
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 37 Feb 15 00:27 uuid
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  6 Feb 15 00:27 vendor
```

The information provided in these filesystem nodes helps you to identify ANAVI Light pHAT vendor, version, product name, etc. For example:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat /proc/device-tree/hat/product
ANAVI Light pHAT

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat /proc/device-tree/hat/vendor
ANAVI
```

More information about device trees, overlays and parameters are available at [the official Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md).

## Pinout

The components of ANAVI Light pHAT utilize the following pins on Raspberry Pi:

| Component    | Pins                                 |
| ----------------- |:------------------------------- |
| I2C               | 3, 5                            |
| EEPROM            | 27, 28                          |
| RGB LED connector | 19, 21, 23                      |
| PIR motion sensor | 7                               |
| UART              | 1, 8, 9, 10                     |

## I2C

The sensors that can be connected to ANAVI Light pHAT communicate with a host microcontroller via a communications standard called **I2C** (Inter-Integrated-Circut). I2C uses two wires, labelled SDA (Serial Data) and SCL (Serial Clock). To function properly, I2C requires a pullup resistor on each of those lines therefore ANAVI Light pHAT includes two 4.7kohm resistors labelled as R6 and R7. If for one reason or another you need to disable the I2C pullup resistors remove R6 and R7.

#### May I use other I2C sensors with ANAVI Light pHAT?

Yes, you can use other I2C sensors with ANAVI Light pHAT but you should take care for their drivers and software support.

#### May I use non-I2C sensors with ANAVI Light pHAT?

No.

#### Can I remotely control ANAVI Light pHAT from a web browser on my smartphone, tablet, or laptop?

Yes, you may install popular open source software for home automation on your Raspberry Pi such as [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) and integrate ANAVI Light pHAT as MQTT JSON component.

#### Is ANAVI Light pHAT software free and open source?

Yes, the official ANAVI Light pHAT software is free and open source. The examples are available under MIT license and the rest is available under GPLv3. Please contact us if you are working on a commercial product and you would like to use the software under alternative commercial license.

#### What 12 V RGB LED strip is included in the kits?

All kits include 1M 12V RGB LED strip with 30 LEDs (size 5050), IP 20 and power consumption of 7.2W.

#### What power supply do I need?
You need a 5 V USB power supply for Raspberry Pi and a 12 V power supply with a standard 2.1x5.5mm DC jack for your light strip. Select a 12 V power supply with sufficient output current and power depending on the length and specifications of your RGB LED strip.

#### Can I use ANAVI Light pHAT without 12V power supply?

No, the main feature for controlling RGB LED strip requires a 12V power supply.

#### Is there a recommended 12V power supply?

ANAVI Light pHAT has been tested using 12V power supplies from SUNNY Computer Technology Europe such as SYS1530-1212-W2E.

Make sure that you are using a 12V power supply from a trusted supplier. Cheap, untested power supplies can be risky and unreliable.

#### Why power supply is not included in any of the kits?

We were unable to source power supplies with universal plugs for US/EU/UK at an acceptable price, and power needs will vary based on application. Nowadays, 12 V power supplies with 2.1x5.5 mm DC jack are a commodity item, therefore you should be able to easily find a suitable unit online or at your local electronics store.
