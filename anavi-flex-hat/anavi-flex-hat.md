```

* Edit */etc/modules* and add the IR pins by adding the following line to the end of the file:

```
lirc_dev
lirc_rpi gpio_in_pin=18 gpio_out_pin=17
```
* Configure */etc/lirc/hardware.conf* in a way to match:

```
# /etc/lirc/hardware.conf
#
# Arguments which will be used when launching lircd
LIRCD_ARGS="--uinput"

#Don't start lircmd even if there seems to be a good config file
#START_LIRCMD=false

#Don't start irexec, even if a good config file seems to exist.
#START_IREXEC=false

#Try to load appropriate kernel modules
LOAD_MODULES=true

# Run "lircd --driver=help" for a list of supported drivers.
#DRIVER="UNCONFIGURED"
DRIVER="default"
# usually /dev/lirc0 is the correct setting for systems using udev
DEVICE="/dev/lirc0"
MODULES="lirc_rpi"

# Default configuration files for your hardware if any
LIRCD_CONF=""
LIRCMD_CONF=""
```

* Edit */boot/config.txt* and configure kernel extensions by adding the following line to the end of the file:

```
dtoverlay=lirc-rpi,gpio_in_pin=18,gpio_out_pin=17
```

* Reboot Raspberry Pi:

```
sudo shutdown -r 0

sudo mv ~/lircd.conf /etc/lirc/lircd.conf
```

* Launch LIRC systemd service again:

```
sudo systemctl start lirc
```

* List all saved keys:

```
irsend LIST /home/pi/lircd.conf ""
```

* * Test the configuration file by sending recorded IR command, for example POWER (please note the exact command may vary for different LIRC configuration files, IR devices and IR remote controls):

```
irsend SEND_ONCE /home/pi/lircd.conf KEY_POWER
```

## Device Tree Overlays

Device Tree (DT) in Linux is a description of the hardware in a system. The DT overlay adds a number of optional elements.

The EEPROM of Anavi Flex contains DT overlay with description of the peripheral devices on the HAT. After adding Anavi to your Raspberry Pi and booting it you  should have some new filesystem nodes at */proc/device-tree/hat*:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls -l /proc/device-tree/hat/
total 0
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  4 Sep 18 23:29 name
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 15 Sep 18 23:27 product
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  7 Sep 18 23:27 product_id
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  7 Sep 18 23:27 product_ver
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 37 Sep 18 23:29 uuid
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 24 Sep 18 23:27 vendor
```

The information provided in these filesystem nodes helps you to identify Anavi Flex vendor, version, product name, etc. For example:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat /proc/device-tree/hat/product
Anavi Flex

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat /proc/device-tree/hat/vendor
Anavi by Leon Anavi
```

More information about device trees, overlays and parameters are available at [the official Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md).

# CHAPTER 5: Schematics

## Pinout

The components of Anavi Flex utilize the following pins on Raspberry Pi:

| Component    | Pins                            |
| ------------ |:------------------------------- |
| I2C          | 3, 5                            |
| EEPROM       | 27, 28                          |
| Relay        | 29                              |
| Button       | 23                              |
| Piezo buzzer | 31                              |
| RGB LED      | 33 (blue), 35 (green), 37 (red) |
| LCD display  | 7, 13, 15, 19, 21, 40           |
| IR LED       | 11                              |
| IR receiver  | 12                              |

## I2C

The sensors that can be connected to Anavi Flex communicate with a host microcontroller via a communications standard called **I2C** (Inter-Integrated-Circut). I2C uses two wires, labelled SDA (Serial Data) and SCL (Serial Clock). To function properly, I2C requires a pullup resistor on each of those lines therefore Anavi Flex includes two 4.7kohm resistors labelled as R9 and R10. If for one reason or another you need to disable the I2C pullup resistors remove R9 and R10.

## LCD Module

1602 LCD character display module can be attached to Anavi Flex. The HAT supports modules with 16 characters on 2 rows which are compatible with the Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller. The LCD module requires 8 data lines to provide data to bits 0-7  but it can be also set to a 4 bit mode which allows sending data in two chunks. Each chuck is 4 bits. The 4 bit mode is convenient as it reduces the number of used GPIO pins on Raspberry Pi. Anavi Flex uses the following wiring for the connector for 1602 LCD modules:

| LCD  | Function             | Raspberry Pi Pin |
| ---- |:-------------------- |:---------------- |
| 1    | GND                  | 6 (GND)
| 2    | 5V                   | 2
| 3    | Contrast             | 6 (GND)
| 4    | RS                   | 7
| 5    | RW                   | 6 (GND)
| 6    | E                    | 40
| 7    | Data 0               | 13
| 8    | Data 1               | 15
| 9    | Data 2               | 19
| 10   | Data 3               | 21
| 11   | Data 4               | -
| 12   | Data 5               | -
| 13   | Data 6               | -
| 14   | Data 7               | -
| 15   | 5V via potentiometer | 2
| 16   | GND                  | 6 (GND)

LED backlight of the LCD display module can be manually adjusted through the potentiometer POT1 using a screwdriver.
