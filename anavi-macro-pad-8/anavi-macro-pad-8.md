## Assembly

### ANAVI Macro Pad 8 Maker Kit

**NOTE:** The **maker** kit is for advanced users and requires soldering skills. If you have a developer kit skip this chapter.

The maker kit provides the printed circuit board and an addressable LED strip. There are also some nice stickers. Other accessories have to be purchased separately. You can use any mechanical switches compatible with Cherry MX plate footprint and 3mm LEDs.

**NOTE:** With the maker kit you can also perform [a hot-swap upgrade of ANAVI Macro 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnFSAm9R4j0). It requires a very specific procedure explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnFSAm9R4j0). If you have in mind a hot-swap upgrade do not solder anything and have a look at [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnFSAm9R4j0).

For soldering and a standard assembly of the **maker kit** several tools are required: a soldering iron, a screwdriver, scissors, tweezers and a keycap puller might be also useful. It is also a good idea to stay safe and get a smoke absorber while soldering, for example [ANAVI Fume Extractor](https://anavi.technology/#products).

Please have [a look at the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlH5sLEsoNc) and follow the steps below to assemble ANAVI Macro Pad 8 **Maker** Kit.

* Solder mechanical switches to the printed circuit board

Any mechanical switches compatible with Cherry MX plate footprint are suitable for ANAVI Macro Pad 8. The developer kit comes with Gateron red mechanical switches. The maker kits allows you to choose another brand, type and color.

Choosing the most appropriate switch for your needs is a matter of personal preference. There are many different brands and colors. For example, the blue mechanical switches are more noisy which could be sometimes fun but also annoying during daily work. The red switches are fast and not very noisy therefore they are often preferred by gamers.

There are two pins on each mechanical switch that must be soldered to the printed circuit board. That makes 16 pins in total for the 8 keys on ANAVI Macro Pad 8. The position of the each of the pins is very specific and you can easily recognize it. One of the pins for the signal coming from the Microchip ATmega32U4 microcontroller, the other pin is for ground.

* Solder 3mm LED

This step is actually optional depending on the the type of the mechanical switch. Some mechanical switches may not have a hole in the plastic enclosure for a 3mm LED. For example, the Gateron red switches have a dedicated place specially for 3mm LEDs.

Each 3mm LED for through-hole soldering has 2 legs. The longer leg is the positive terminal, also known as anode. The shorter leg is negative and also known as cathode.

The shorter leg that indicates the negative terminal must go into the square hole of the PCB. ANAVI Macro Pad 8 has 8 mechanical switches therefore 8 LEDs are required. If you want you can use different color of the LEDs. You can even mix colors.

* Solder WS2812B addressable LED strip to the back of the printed circuit board.

Using scissors cut a little bit from both ends of the LED strip to make sure it will stretched when placed on the board. However it is tricky, be careful and make sure enough from the pads are available to make a good contact after soldering them.

It is very important to properly set the direction of the WS2812B LED strip. On the LED strip you will notice small arrows indicating the direction. They should point from the microUSB connector towards the other end of the PCB as shown [in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlH5sLEsoNc).

**NOTE:** It is very important to solder the addressable WS2812B LED strip in the correct direction as shown [in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlH5sLEsoNc). A mistake can severely damage the keyboard.

Once you are ready with these 3 steps your ANAVI Macro Pad 8 should look just like a developer kit having all accessories soldered. Therefore the next steps are the same as for both the developer and the maker kit.

### ANAVI Macro Pad 8 Developer Kit

Please have [a look at the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlH5sLEsoNc) and follow the steps below to assemble ANAVI Macro Pad 8 **Developer** Kit. Although you can do it with your bare hands, simple tools like a screwdriver, tweezers and a keycap puller might be useful.

* Stickers

*This step is optional.* Each kit includes a set of stickers. Feel free to add them to the translucent keycaps included in ANAVI Macro Pad 8 developer kit. You can do it with your bare hands or eventually with the help of tweezers.

You can place a sticker on the top or on the side of the keycap. If you like retro electronics you may find some similarities in this approach to the famous keyboard of the best selling personal computer of the 20th century Commodore 64.

ANAVI Macro Pad 8 is powered by the popular open source firmware QMK which allows you to create various layouts. You can make a keymap with 2 or more layouts. A sticker on the side of the keycap might be useful as a visual aid to indicate the additional function of the key.

* Keycaps

Place all keycaps on the 8 mechanical switches of ANAVI Macro Pad 8. You can easily do this with your bare hands. It takes just a few seconds.

As you can see [in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlH5sLEsoNc), a keycap puller might be useful if you make a mistake and want to pull off a keycap and place it on another location.

* Peel Off Protective Films from the Acrylic Enclosure

Peel off the protective films from both sides of the two laser cut transparent acrylic parts. The removal of the protective films is quite annoying but once you get rid of them, the acrylic enclosure will be crystal clear and fully transparent.

* Assemble the Acrylic Enclosure

Assemble the acrylic enclosures. In the cardboard box you also will find M3 black plastic screws, nuts and standoffs. Although you can assemble them with your bare hands a screw driver might be handy.

First place 4 of the stand-offs with screws to the bottom acrylic part. After that, place ANAVI Macro Pad 8 on top of them. The printed circuit board has 4 mounting holes for this purpose.

Add the rest of stand-offs on top of the ANAVI Macro Pad 8 to secure the printed circuit board to the bottom part as shown in the video. Place the top acrylic part and fasten it with the 4 M3 nuts. Finally add the silicon protective pads to the screws on the bottom.

* Mini OLED Display

*This step is optional.* The default open source QMK firmware for ANAVI Macro Pad 8 supports mini OLED display connected over the communication bus I2C.

By default. the mini display is in yellow-blue 0.96" I2C OLED. It comes with 4 jumper wires which might be useful for debugging purposes or if you plan to make a custom 3D printed case. However for the default acrylic enclosure the wires are not needed.

Peel off the protected film and place the mini OLED display as shown in the video to ANAVI Macro Pad 8. Pay attention to the labels that indicated the pin connectors of the display. They must match the labels on the keyboard.

* Turn On ANAVI Macro Pad 8

Gently use a USB to microUSB cable to connect ANAVI Macro Pad 8 to a personal computer. Please be careful with the microUSB connector, because a harsh bending of the USB cable may damage the microUSB connector.

Thanks to the QMK firmware, ANAVI Macro Pad 8 will be detected as human interface device and should work out of the box. Furthermore with QMK you have the freedom to fully customize each key.

Please note that a USB to microUSB cable is **not** included in any of the kits. Reuse a cable from an old electronic device or purchase a cable according to your taste. Make sure that the cable supports both power and data transfer over USB.

# CHAPTER 4: Hardware Schematics

## Pinout

ANAVI Macro Pad 8 utilize the following pins on ATmega32U4:

| Component           | Pins                                   |
| ------------------- |:-------------------------------------- |
| I2C                 | PD0, PD1                               |
| Mechanical switches | PD4, PF6, PB5, PE6, PF5, PF7, PB4, PC6 |
| 3mm LEDs (backlit)  | PD7                                    |
| WS2812B LED strip   | PF4                                    |

## I2C

The mini OLED display that can be connected to ANAVI Macro Pad 8 communicate with a host microcontroller via a communications standard called **I2C** (Inter-Integrated-Circut). I2C uses two wires, labeled SDA (Serial Data) and SCL (Serial Clock). To function properly, I2C requires a pullup resistor on each of those lines therefore ANAVI Macro Pad 8 includes two 4.7kohm resistors labeled as R13 and R14. If for one reason or another you need to disable the I2C pullup resistors remove R13 and R14.

# CHAPTER 5: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and Troubleshooting

* How to fix `The firmware is too large! 28866/28672 (194 bytes over)`?

The easiest way to reduce the size of QMK firmware with your custom new keymap for ANAVI Macro Pad 8 is to cut some of the RGB lighting animations and effects.

For example, in your custom keymap you can create `config.h` in the keymap directory that overwrites the main `config.h` with a reduced number of supported RGB lighting animations and effects:

```
#pragma once

#undef RGBLIGHT_ANIMATIONS
#define RGBLIGHT_EFFECT_BREATHING
#define RGBLIGHT_EFFECT_CHRISTMAS
#define RGBLIGHT_EFFECT_RAINBOW_MOOD
#define RGBLIGHT_EFFECT_SNAKE
```

* How to fix `avrdude` if it not responding properly on GNU/Linux distributions?

On some GNU/Linux distributions, for example Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS, the following errors might appear when uploading from with avrdude through QMK CLI or Arduno IDE:

```
avrdude: error: programmer did not respond to command: set addr
```
or
```
avrdude: Expected signature for ATmega32U4 is 1E 95 87
```

This is frequently caused by ModemManager, a DBus-activated daemon which controls mobile broadband (2G/3G/4G) devices and connections. The solution is to stop `modemmanager` systemd service:

```
systemctl stop ModemManager
```

This affects all devices with Microchip ATmega32U4, including Arduino Leonardo. For more details have a look at [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/issues/7690).
