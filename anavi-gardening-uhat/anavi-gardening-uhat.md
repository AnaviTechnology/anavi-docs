cd anavi-examples
```

### Sensors

It is mandatory to enable **SPI**, **1-Wire** and **I2C** to use all of the sensors supported by ANAVI Gardening uHAT.

#### Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensors

Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2 and v2.0 measures the volumetric content of water inside the soil and retrieves the moisture level by capacitive sensing rather than resistive sensing like other sensors. The benefit of using a capacitive soil moisture sensor is the lack of corrosion and longer lifespan.

nlike Raspberry Pi Pico, the recently released microcontroller, all versions and models of the Raspberry Pi single-board computers do not include an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). ANAVI Gardening uHAT adds Microchip MCP3002 to your Raspberry Pi.

Microchip MCP3002 is a 10-bit resolution, dual channel ADC with SPI hardware bus. It can be connected to any Raspberry Pi single board computer version and model, including Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi 0. However, this tutorial is not for Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. For more details about the wiring of Microchip MCP3002 a Raspberry Pi single-board computer have a look at [this tutorial](https://www.anavi.org/article/238/).

Make sure **SPI** has been enabled. Python3 script for reading data from a couple of capacitive soil moisture sensors through Microchip MCP3002 ADC is available at the anavi-examples repository in GitHub. The script relies on popular Python libraries spidev and RPi.GPIO. Open a terminal and run the following commands torun the script from `anavi-examples`:

```
cd ~/anavi-examples/anavi-gardening-uhat/soil-moistore-sensors/python/
python3 soil-moistore-sensors.py
```

#### Waterproof DS18B20 Temperature Sensor

Make sure the Raspberry Pi is turned off and attach the waterproof DS18B20 temperature sensor to the dedicated terminal connector on ANAVI Gardening uHAT. The red wire of the sensor is for 3.3V, the black wire is for GND and the yellow wire is for the signal. 1-Wire must have been enabled. Power on the Raspberry Pi and read the temperature values as follows:

```
cat /sys/bus/w1/devices/*/w1_slave
```

#### Temperature Sensor (BMP180)

##### Python

Follow the steps below to use the BMP180 I2C temperature and barometric pressure sensor with ANAVI Gardening uHAT:

## Device Tree Overlays

Device Tree (DT) in Linux is a description of the hardware in a system. The DT overlay adds a number of optional elements.

The EEPROM of ANAVI Gardening uHAT contains DT overlay with description of the peripheral devices on the HAT. After adding Anavi to your Raspberry Pi and booting it you  should have some new filesystem nodes at */proc/device-tree/hat*:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls -l /proc/device-tree/hat/
total 0
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  4 Feb 15 00:27 name
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 20 Feb 15 00:27 product
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  7 Feb 15 00:27 product_id
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  7 Feb 15 00:27 product_ver
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 37 Feb 15 00:27 uuid
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  6 Feb 15 00:27 vendor
```

The information provided in these filesystem nodes helps you to identify ANAVI Gardening uHAT vendor, version, product name, etc. For example:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat /proc/device-tree/hat/product
ANAVI Gardening uHAT

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat /proc/device-tree/hat/vendor
ANAVI
```

More information about device trees, overlays and parameters are available at [the official Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md).

# Schematics

## Pinout

The components of ANAVI Gardening uHAT utilize the following pins on Raspberry Pi:

| Component    | Pins                            |
| ------------ |:------------------------------- |
| I2C          | 3, 5                            |
| EEPROM       | 27, 28                          |
| MCP3002      | 19, 21, 23, 24                  |
| UART         | 1, 8, 9, 10                     |
| LED D1       | 15                              |
| LED D2       | 16                              |

## I2C

The sensors that can be connected to ANAVI Gardening uHAT communicate with a host microcontroller via a communications standard called **I2C** (Inter-Integrated-Circut). I2C uses two wires, labelled SDA (Serial Data) and SCL (Serial Clock). To function properly, I2C requires a pullup resistor on each of those lines therefore ANAVI Gardening uHAT includes two 4.7kohm resistors labelled as R6 and R7. If for one reason or another you need to disable the I2C pullup resistors remove R6 and R7.
