## Powering ANAVI Light Controller

ANAVI Light Controller requires 12V power supply for the RGB LED strip.


ANAVI Light Controller has been tested using 12V power supplies from SUNNY Computer Technology Europe such as [SYS1530-1212-W2E](https://www.sunny-euro.com/en/products/sys1530-1212-w2e-europe-2-1x5-5x11-s-2wc-1-4m-4-5ft). The output current depends on the leght of the RGB LED strip and the number of LEDs in it. ANAVI Light Controller has been tested with power supplies with output current in the range from 1A to 5A. Using power supplies and RGB LED stip that requires higher output current than 5A is not recommended. Make sure that you are using a 12V power supply from a trusted supplier. Cheap, untested power supplies can be risky and unreliable.

## Configure ANAVI Light Controller

[Video tutorial for getting started with ANAVI Light Controller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_81CuuGm0Y)

Turn on ANAVI Light Controller by plugging an appropriate 12V power supply. As soon as the board is turned on for the very first time it will create a temporary WiFi access point. Connect to it from your computer, smartphone or tablet.

The default software of ANAVI Light Controller has a captive portal which guides you through the configurations. As you see in the video you have to select your WiFi network and enter a password if it is not open.

Our open source software relies on the machine to machine communication protocol MQTT to control the lights and to report data from the sensors. You can connect to your own MQTT broker or just leave the default configurations and connect to the public broker as shown in the video.

It very important to copy the machine ID. Later it is needed to identify your device.

When you are ready just click save. If you have entered valid credentials in a moment ANAVI Light Controller will connect to your WiFi network and the configured MQTT broker. This way the configuration is complete and ANAVI Light Controller will turn off its temporary WiFi access point. After that your device, for example smartphone as in the video, will automatically connect again to your WiFi network.

To verify that ANAVI Light Controller is up and running open a modern web browser and visit demo.anavi.technology. Enter your machine ID. Check the advanced settings only if you are not using the default public MQTT broker. Click connect.

From this web page you can turn on and off as well as to change the colors of the RGB LED strip.

The strip can also be controlled from the command line with a client such as [mosquitto_pub](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_pub-1.html). For example:

    mosquitto_pub -h iot.eclipse.org -d -t "cmnd/####/color" -m '{"color":{ "r":0, "g":255, "b":0 }}'
    mosquitto_pub -h iot.eclipse.org -d -t "cmnd/####/color" -m '{"brightness":128}'

with '####' replaced with the machine ID and color and brightness values between 0 and 256.


## Reset to Factory Defaults

If you decide to change the settings of ANAVI Light Controller you need to reset the board and configure it again.

To reset ANAVI Light Controller press the button and hold it for 10 seconds until the red light is blinking. After resetting the board there will be a steady red light that indicates that the temporary WiFi access point is on and you can proceed with the configuration again.

# CHAPTER 5: Schematics

## Pinout

The components of ANAVI Light Controller relies on ESP8266 (ESP-12 module) and utilizes the following pins:

| Component           | Pins                            |  Arduino Pin ID |
| ------------------- |:------------------------------- |-----------------|
| I2C                 | 13, 14                          |                 |  
| RGB LED connector   | 5, 6, 7                         | 12, 13, 14      |
| Indication LED (D1) | 7                               | 16              |
| Reset button (SW1)  | 12                              | 0               |
| UART                | 15, 16                          |                 |

## I2C

The sensors that can be connected to ANAVI Light Controller communicate with a host microcontroller via a communications standard called **I2C** (Inter-Integrated-Circut). I2C uses two wires, labelled SDA (Serial Data) and SCL (Serial Clock). To function properly, I2C requires a pullup resistor on each of those lines therefore ANAVI Light Controller includes two 4.7kohm resistors labelled as R6 and R7. If for one reason or another you need to disable the I2C pullup resistors remove R6 and R7.
