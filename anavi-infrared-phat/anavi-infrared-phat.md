## Infrared and LIRC

ANAVI Infrared pHAT has built-in infrared receiver and transmitter. [LIRC](http://www.lirc.org/) (Linux Infrared Remote Control) is popular open source application for sending and receiving data over infrared on GNU/Linux distributions. This chapter provides guidelines how to enable ANAVI Infrared pHAT infrared receiver and transmitter on **Raspbian** and to use LIRC.

In 2019 lirc_rpi, the Linux kernel module provided with Raspbian before, was replaced with gpio-ir and gpio-ir-tx. This tutorial is updated for Raspbian Buster. If you need to setup ANAVI Infrared pHAT on an older version of Raspbian, for example from 2018-04-18, please [have a look at the **old** user's manual](http://anavi.technology/files/anavi-infrared-phat-2018.pdf).

## Setting up LIRC

Perform the steps below to build LIRC from source, to patch it and to enable the infrared receiver and transmitter on ANAVI Infrared pHAT:

* Install dependencies

```
sudo su -c "grep '^deb ' /etc/apt/sources.list | sed 's/^deb/deb-src/g' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/deb-src.list"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y vim devscripts dh-exec doxygen expect libasound2-dev libftdi1-dev libsystemd-dev libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libusb-dev man2html-base portaudio19-dev socat xsltproc python3-yaml dh-python libx11-dev python3-dev python3-setuptools
```

* Download LIRC source code

```
mkdir ~/lirc-src
cd ~/lirc-src
apt source lirc
```

* Apply a patch to fix LIRC for Raspberry Pi

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralassembly/raspi/master/lirc-gpio-ir-0.10.patch
patch -p0 -i lirc-gpio-ir-0.10.patch
cd lirc-0.10.1
debuild -uc -us -b
```

* Install LIRC (built on the previous step)

```
cd ~/lirc-src
sudo apt install -y ./liblirc0_0.10.1-6.3~deb10u1_armhf.deb ./liblircclient0_0.10.1-6.3~deb10u1_armhf.deb ./lirc_0.10.1-6.3~deb10u1_armhf.deb
```

* Edit `/etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf` and make sure that driver and device are set as:

```
driver          = default
device          = /dev/lirc1
```

**NOTE:** Device **/dev/lirc1** is the receiver and device **/dev/lirc0** is the transmitter. Initially **/dev/lirc1** is used to scan a remote control. After that the configuration has to be updated to **/dev/lirc0** and LIRC daemon must be restated with `sudo systemctl restart lircd` in order to send infrared commands.

* Edit */boot/config.txt* (with sudo or as root) and configure kernel extensions by adding the following line to the end of the file:

```
dtoverlay=gpio-ir,gpio_pin=18
dtoverlay=gpio-ir-tx,gpio_pin=17
```

* Reboot Raspberry Pi:

```
sudo shutdown -r 0
```

## Using IR Receiver

Follow the steps below to verify that the IR receiver is working as expected:

* Stop LIRC systemd service:

```
sudo systemctl stop lircd
```

* Start outputting raw data from the IR receiver

```
mode2 -d /dev/lirc1
```

* Point a remote control at the IR receiver on ANAVI Infrared pHAT and press its buttons. If the IR receiver is configured successfully you will see similar output:

```
space 3662230
pulse 2428
space 594
pulse 1201
space 596
pulse 1230
space 595
pulse 1209
space 590
pulse 1204
```

## Using IR LED

Follow the steps below to create LIRC configuration file and test the infrared transmitter:

* Stop LIRC systemd service

```
sudo systemctl stop lircd
```

* List all available names for buttons supported by LIRC:

```
irrecord --list-namespace
```

* Type in the following command to create new LIRC control configuration file and follow the on screen instructions to scan a remote control:

```
irrecord -d /dev/lirc1 ~/lircd.conf
```

Example configuration output with name hifi:
```
Using driver default on device /dev/lirc1

irrecord -  application for recording IR-codes for usage with lirc
Copyright (C) 1998,1999 Christoph Bartelmus(lirc@bartelmus.de)

This program will record the signals from your remote control
and create a config file for lircd.

A proper config file for lircd is maybe the most vital part of this
package, so you should invest some time to create a working config
file. Although I put a good deal of effort in this program it is often
not possible to automatically recognize all features of a remote
control. Often short-comings of the receiver hardware make it nearly
impossible. If you have problems to create a config file READ THE
DOCUMENTATION at https://sf.net/p/lirc-remotes/wiki

If there already is a remote control of the same brand available at
http://sf.net/p/lirc-remotes you might want to try using such a
remote as a template. The config files already contains all
parameters of the protocol used by remotes of a certain brand and
knowing these parameters makes the job of this program much
easier. There are also template files for the most common protocols
available. Templates can be downloaded using irdb-get(1). You use a
template file by providing the path of the file as a command line
parameter.

Please take the time to finish the file as described in
https://sourceforge.net/p/lirc-remotes/wiki/Checklist/ an send it
to  <lirc@bartelmus.de> so it can be made available to others.

Press RETURN to continue.

Checking for ambient light  creating too much disturbances.
Please don't press any buttons, just wait a few seconds...

No significant noise (received 0 bytes)

Enter name of remote (only ascii, no spaces) :hifi
Using hifi.lircd.conf as output filename

Now start pressing buttons on your remote control.

It is very important that you press many different buttons randomly
and hold them down for approximately one second. Each button should
generate at least one dot but never more than ten dots of output.
Don't stop pressing buttons until two lines of dots (2x80) have
been generated.

Press RETURN now to start recording.

Now hold down button "KEY_POWER".

Please enter the name for the next button (press <ENTER> to finish recording)

Checking for toggle bit mask.
Please press an arbitrary button repeatedly as fast as possible.
Make sure you keep pressing the SAME button and that you DON'T HOLD
the button down!.
If you can't see any dots appear, wait a bit between button presses.

Press RETURN to continue.
..............................Cannot find any toggle mask.
You have only recorded one button in a non-raw configuration file.
This file doesn't really make much sense, you should record at
least two or three buttons to get meaningful results. You can add
more buttons next time you run irrecord.


Successfully written config file hifi.lircd.conf
```

* Backup the original LIRC configuration file:

```
sudo mv /etc/lirc/lircd.conf /etc/lirc/lircd-backup.conf
```

* Load the new configuration file, for example:

**NOTE: The name of configuration depends on the selected name of remote. Please adapt the command below depending on your name of remote!**

```
sudo mv hifi.lircd.conf /etc/lirc/lircd.conf
```

* Switch LIRC configurations to the device for transmitting. Edit again `/etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf` and make sure that driver and device are set as:

```
driver          = default
device          = /dev/lirc0
```

**NOTE:** In this case the device is **/dev/lirc0**.

* Launch LIRC systemd service again:

```
sudo systemctl start lircd
```

* List all saved keys, for example:

**NOTE: Please adapt the command below depending on your name of remote!**

```
irsend LIST hifi ""
```

* * Test the configuration file by sending recorded IR command, for example POWER (please note the exact command may vary for different LIRC configuration files, IR devices and IR remote controls):

**NOTE: Please adapt the command below depending on your name of remote!**

```
irsend SEND_ONCE hifi KEY_POWER
```

**NOTE: Please keep in mind that in rare cases some devices might require codes to be sent in short bursts, for example:**

```
irsend send_once hifi KEY_POWER KEY_POWER KEY_POWER
```

## Device Tree Overlays

Device Tree (DT) in Linux is a description of the hardware in a system. The DT overlay adds a number of optional elements.

The EEPROM of ANAVI Infrared pHAT contains DT overlay with description of the peripheral devices on the HAT. After adding Anavi to your Raspberry Pi and booting it you  should have some new filesystem nodes at */proc/device-tree/hat*:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls -l /proc/device-tree/hat/
total 0
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  4 Feb 15 00:27 name
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 20 Feb 15 00:27 product
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  7 Feb 15 00:27 product_id
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  7 Feb 15 00:27 product_ver
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 37 Feb 15 00:27 uuid
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  6 Feb 15 00:27 vendor
```

The information provided in these filesystem nodes helps you to identify ANAVI Infrared pHAT vendor, version, product name, etc. For example:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat /proc/device-tree/hat/product
ANAVI Infrared pHAT

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat /proc/device-tree/hat/vendor
ANAVI
```

More information about device trees, overlays and parameters are available at [the official Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md).

# CHAPTER 5: Schematics

## Pinout

The components of ANAVI Infrared pHAT utilize the following pins on Raspberry Pi:

| Component    | Pins                            |
| ------------ |:------------------------------- |
| I2C          | 3, 5                            |
| EEPROM       | 27, 28                          |
| IR LED       | 11                              |
| IR receiver  | 12                              |
| UART         | 1, 8, 9, 10                     |

## I2C

The sensors that can be connected to ANAVI Infrared pHAT communicate with a host microcontroller via a communications standard called **I2C** (Inter-Integrated-Circut). I2C uses two wires, labelled SDA (Serial Data) and SCL (Serial Clock). To function properly, I2C requires a pullup resistor on each of those lines therefore ANAVI Infrared pHAT includes two 4.7kohm resistors labelled as R6 and R7. If for one reason or another you need to disable the I2C pullup resistors remove R6 and R7.
