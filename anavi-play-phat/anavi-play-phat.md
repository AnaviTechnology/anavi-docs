## Device Tree Overlays

Device Tree (DT) in Linux is a description of the hardware in a system. The DT overlay adds a number of optional elements.

The EEPROM of ANAVI Play pHAT contains DT overlay with description of the peripheral devices on the HAT. After adding Anavi to your Raspberry Pi and booting it you  should have some new filesystem nodes at */proc/device-tree/hat*:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls -l /proc/device-tree/hat/
total 0
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  4 Feb 15 00:27 name
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 20 Feb 15 00:27 product
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  7 Feb 15 00:27 product_id
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  7 Feb 15 00:27 product_ver
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 37 Feb 15 00:27 uuid
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  6 Feb 15 00:27 vendor
```

The information provided in these filesystem nodes helps you to identify ANAVI Play pHAT vendor, version, product name, etc. For example:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat /proc/device-tree/hat/product
ANAVI Play pHAT

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat /proc/device-tree/hat/vendor
ANAVI
```

More information about device trees, overlays and parameters are available at [the official Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md).

| Button B     | 37                              |

For more details have a look at [the KiCad project which is available in GitHub](https://github.com/AnaviTechnology/anavi-play-phat).

## I2C

The sensors that can be connected to ANAVI Play pHAT communicate with a host microcontroller via a communications standard called **I2C** (Inter-Integrated-Circut). I2C uses two wires, labelled SDA (Serial Data) and SCL (Serial Clock). To function properly, I2C requires a pullup resistor on each of those lines therefore ANAVI Play pHAT includes two 4.7kohm resistors labelled as R6 and R7. If for one reason or another you need to disable the I2C pullup resistors remove R6 and R7.
