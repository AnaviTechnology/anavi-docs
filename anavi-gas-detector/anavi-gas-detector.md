## Assembly

You can assemble ANAVI Gas Detector with your bare hands and a screw driver following the steps below:

* Add sensors to your ANAVI Gas Detector.
* Optionally, you may also assemble the simple acrylic case by removing the protective film and mounting screws.
* Use 5V power supply and plug an appropriate cable in the microUSB of ANAVI Gas Detector to turn on the board.

## Powering ANAVI Gas Detector

ANAVI Gas Detector has been tested using various 5V power supplies and USB to microUSB cables. It is recommended to use 5V power supply with 1A or higher current output. Make sure that you are using a 5V power supply from a trusted supplier. Cheap, untested power supplies can be risky and unreliable.

## Configure ANAVI Gas Detector

[Video tutorial for getting started with ANAVI Light Controller, same procedure for ANAVI Gas Detector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_81CuuGm0Y)

Turn on ANAVI Gas Detector by plugging an appropriate power supply. As soon as the board is turned on for the very first time it will create a temporary WiFi access point. Connect to it from your computer, smartphone or tablet.

The default software of ANAVI Gas Detector has a captive portal which guides you through the configurations. As you see in the video you have to select your WiFi network and enter a password if it is not open.

Our open source software relies on the machine to machine communication protocol MQTT to report data from the sensors. You can connect to your own MQTT broker or just leave the default configurations and connect to the public broker as shown in the video.

It very important to copy the machine ID. Later it is needed to identify your device.

When you are ready just click save. If you have entered valid credentials in a moment ANAVI Gas Detector will connect to your WiFi network and the configured MQTT broker. This way the configuration is complete and ANAVI Gas Detector will turn off its temporary WiFi access point. After that your device, for example smartphone as in the video, will automatically connect again to your WiFi network.

To verify that ANAVI Gas Detector is up and running open a modern web browser and visit demo.anavi.technology. Enter your machine ID. Check the advanced settings only if you are not using the default public MQTT broker. Click connect.

## Reset to Factory Defaults

If you decide to change the settings of ANAVI Gas Detector you need to reset the board and configure it again.

To reset ANAVI Gas Detector press the button and hold it for 10 seconds until the red light is blinking. After resetting the board there will be a steady red light that indicates that the temporary WiFi access point is on and you can proceed with the configuration again.

Please have a look at [the YouTube video that shows the exact steps for compiling and uploading an Arduino sketch to ANAVI Gas Detector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMIkPuz0ZJs).

**Note:** you have to be quick between step 5 and 6. Remember to press and **hold** SW1 until the upload completes.

# OTA Firmware Upgrade
Recent versions of the official firmware also support OTA firmware updates by putting a firmare binary on a web server and then triggering the update via a MQTT message. This can be very convenient, as you do not have to connect the device to your computer.

## Check support
If you are unsure if your current firmware supports OTA update, you can first check if your ANAVI Gas Detector is already setup to receive MQTT commands.

To do this, send a MQTT message to the topic "cmnd/[deviceId]/line1" with message body "test", for example using mosquitto_pub:

```
mosquitto_pub -h [mqttserver] -p 1883 -t cmnd/b5cfb5cfb5cfb5cfb5cfb5cfb5cfb5cf/line1 -u [mqttuser] -P [mqttpass] -m "test"
```

When this message causes the first line of your ANAVI Gas Detector display to change to "test", OTA updates should be supported.
If not (after double checking that you used the correct topic and deviceId), please first update to a more recent firmware version.

(To reset the line again to the default display, just send an empty message to the same topic).


## Build binary firmware image
Using the arduino build setting above, instead of clicking Upload (Ctrl+U), use Menu Sketch -> Export compiled binary (CTRL+ALT+S). A .bin file will be created in the same folder as the .ino file.
Copy this file to an HTTP webserver, for example a server in your local network.

## Trigger update
The devices listens to MQTT messages in topic "cmnd/[deviceid]/update" and expects messages to be in the format

```
{"file":"/[filePath]", "server": "[server IP or DNS name]"}
```

For example, if you put the file at http://192.168.100.46/anavi.bin:

```
{"file":"/anavi.bin", "server": "192.168.100.46"}
```

If your server does not listen on port 80, you can provide the port, for example for  http://192.168.100.46:8080/anavi.bin:

```
{"file":"/anavi.bin", "server": "192.168.100.46", "port": 8080}
```

Example for sending an update message using mosquitto_pub:

```
mosquitto_pub -h [mqttserver] -p 1883 -t cmnd/b5cfb5cfb5cfb5cfb5cfb5cfb5cfb5cf/update -u [mqttuser] -P [mqttpass] -m "{\"file\":\"anavi.bin\", \"server\":\"192.168.100.46\", \"port\":8080}
```
***Note: To ensure successful update, please specify the file with leading slash ('/'), use an HTTP web server, not HTTPS, and -- when run from the command line -- escape quote characters***

On receipt of this message, ANAVI Gas Detector will download the file from the specified server, update the firmware and restart. As with the normal firmware update, your saved settings such as WiFi and MQTT server settings should remain as configured.

***Note: After the update, you may find that readings from the DHT22 sensor no longer work and temperature and humidity are shown as "0". In this case, please powercycle the device (unplug power until display turns off, then plug power in again)***


# CHAPTER 4: Home Assistant

[Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) is a free and open-source home automation platform running on Python 3 with more than 1200 components for integration with popular Internet of Things.

ANAVI Gas Detector can be easily integrated in Home Assistant using the component [MQTT sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.mqtt/). This component supports JSON in the payload of the MQTT messages. To use, in **configuration.yaml** specify MQTT broker and register the sensor with the correspoding MQTT topic, for example:

* Configure MQTT broker:

```
mqtt:
  broker: 127.0.0.1
```

* Register the MQTT sensor:

```
sensor:
    - platform: mqtt
      name: "Temperature"
      unit_of_measurement: 'C'
      state_topic: "home/room/temperature"
      value_template: "{{value_json.temperature}}"
    - platform: mqtt
      name: "Humidity"
      unit_of_measurement: '%'
      state_topic: "home/room/humidity"
      value_template: "{{value_json.humidity}}"
```

## I2C

The digital sensors compatible with the ANAVI Gas Detector communicate with the host microcontroller using the **I2C** (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol. I2C operates over two lines: SDA (Serial Data) and SCL (Serial Clock). For proper functionality, both lines require pull-up resistors. To ensure this, the ANAVI Gas Detector includes two 4.7kΩ resistors, labeled R2 and R3. If you need to disable the I2C pull-up resistors for any reason, simply remove R2 and R3.
