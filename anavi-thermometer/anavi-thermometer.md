#### Waterproof Temperature DS18B20 Sensor

ANAVI Thermometer Advanced and Developer kits include a waterproof 1-wire DS18B20 sensor appropriate for measuring temperature in liquids. Attached the sensor to the designated terminal on ANAVI Thermometer. You can even connect multiple DS18B20 sensors to the terminal because each sensor has a unique 64-bit ID burned in at the factory to differentiate them. The typical color codes for the waterproof DS18B20 sensor are:

* GND - black
* Data - yellow
* VCC - red

## Assembly

You can assemble ANAVI Thermometer with your bare hands and a screw driver following the steps below:

* Add sensors to your ANAVI Thermometer.
* Optionally, you may also assemble the simple acrylic case by removing the protective film and mounting screws.
* Use 5V power supply and plug an appropriate cable in the microUSB of ANAVI Thermometer to turn on the board.

## Powering ANAVI Thermometer

ANAVI Thermometer has been tested using various 5V power supplies and USB to microUSB cables. It is recommended to use 5V power supply with 1A or higher current output. Make sure that you are using a 5V power supply from a trusted supplier. Cheap, untested power supplies can be risky and unreliable.

## Configure ANAVI Thermometer

[Video tutorial for getting started with ANAVI Light Controller, same procedure for ANAVI Thermometer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_81CuuGm0Y)

Turn on ANAVI Thermometer by plugging an appropriate power supply. As soon as the board is turned on for the very first time it will create a temporary WiFi access point. Connect to it from your computer, smartphone or tablet.

The default software of ANAVI Thermometer has a captive portal which guides you through the configurations. As you see in the video you have to select your WiFi network and enter a password if it is not open.

Our open source software relies on the machine to machine communication protocol MQTT to report data from the sensors. You can connect to your own MQTT broker or just leave the default configurations and connect to the public broker as shown in the video.

Recent versions of the firmware support [Home Assistant MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/) which makes it very convenient to add ANAVI Thermometer to Home Assistant.  For this to work, you need to enter the sensor name (such as "Master Bedroom") that will be used for this Thermometer on the setup screen.  See Chapter 5 for more details.

Recent versions of the firmware support Over-the-Air upgrades of the software.  To enable this, you need to specify the IP address or DNS domain name of a web server that hosts the firmware. See Chapter 3 for more details.

It very important to copy the machine ID. Later it is needed to identify your device.

When you are ready just click save. If you have entered valid credentials in a moment ANAVI Thermometer will connect to your WiFi network and the configured MQTT broker. This way the configuration is complete and ANAVI Thermometer will turn off its temporary WiFi access point. After that your device, for example smartphone as in the video, will automatically connect again to your WiFi network.

To verify that ANAVI Thermometer is up and running open a modern web browser and visit demo.anavi.technology. Enter your machine ID. Check the advanced settings only if you are not using the default public MQTT broker. Click connect.

## Reset to Factory Defaults

If you decide to change the settings of ANAVI Thermometer you need to reset the board and configure it again.

To reset ANAVI Thermometer press the button and hold it for approximately 6 seconds until the red light stops blinking. After resetting the board there will be a steady red light that indicates that the temporary WiFi access point is on and you can proceed with the configuration again. The reset button works once the ANAVI Thermometer has successfully connected to a WiFi network. If you are running a recent enough version of the firmware, it also works for 2 seconds after you power on the device (while the red LED is blinking quickly).

# CHAPTER 3: Software Development

## Default Firmware

By default ANAVI Thermometer comes with [this free and open source Arduino sketch](https://github.com/AnaviTechnology/anavi-thermometer-sw).

## USB to UART Module

For uploading firmware to ANAVI Thermometer you need USB to UART module. All kits include CP2102 which out of the box on GNU/Linux distributions. Drivers for MS Windows and Mac OS X are [available at silabs.com](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).

## Setting up the Arduino IDE

1. Install the Arduino IDE following the instructions from from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

2. Add the ESP8266 board package: In **File > Preferences** input http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into the Additional Board Manager URLs field.

3. In **Tools > Board ... > Boards manager** find and add the **ESP8266** package. Now "Generic ESP8266" should be an option in the **Tools > Boards** menu. Select it.

4. In **Tools > Flash Size:** select **4M (1M SPIFFS)**

5. Go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...** and include the following dependencies of the default firmware for ANAVI Thermometer:

Please double check [the list of dependencies at the README](https://github.com/AnaviTechnology/anavi-thermometer-sw#dependencies).

*Note: Issues might be experienced if using different versions of the libraries.*

## Flashing Custom Firmware

Follow the steps below to compile and flash custom firmware on ANAVI Thermometer from Arduino IDE:

1. To flash the firmware from Arduino IDE select Tools > Generic ESP8266 Module (Flash mode: DIO, Flash frequency: 40MHz, CPU frequency: 80MHz, Flash size: 4M, Debug port: Disabled, Debug level: None, Reset method: ck, Upload speed: 115200, Port: /dev/ttyUSB0). Set the flash size to 4M (1M SPIFFS). You might need to adjust the port if your USB to serial debug cable is connected on a different port.

2. After that press load an Arduino sketch. [A simple blinking LED example is available at GitHub](https://github.com/AnaviTechnology/anavi-examples/blob/master/anavi-light-controller/anavi-blinking-led/anavi-blinking-led.ino)

3. In Arudino IDE click Verify/Compile (Ctrl+R)

4. Connect ANAVI Thermometer to the USB to serial debug board: GND to GND, TX cable to RX of ANAVI Thermometer and RX cable to TX of ANAVI Thermometer.

5. In Arudino IDE click Upload (Ctrl+U)

6. Press and **hold** the RESET button on ANAVI Thermometer. Plug the 5V power supply in the jack of ANAVI Thermometer (without releasing the RESET button).

7. In Arduino IDE verify that the upload has been started. Hold RESET until the upload completes.

The output in Arduino IDE for successful flashing is:

Please have a look at [the YouTube video that shows the exact steps for compiling and uploading an Arduino sketch to ANAVI Thermometer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMIkPuz0ZJs).

**Note:** you have to be quick between step 5 and 6. Remember to press and **hold** RESET until the upload completes.

# OTA Firmware Upgrade
Recent versions of the official firmware also support OTA firmware updates by putting a firmare binary on a web server and then triggering the update via a MQTT message. This can be very convenient, as you do not have to connect the device to your computer.

## Check support

If the captive portal contained a "OTA server" field, your software supports OTA upgrades.

If you are unsure if your current firmware supports OTA update, you can first check if your ANAVI Thermometer is already setup to receive MQTT commands.

To do this, send a MQTT message to the topic "cmnd/[deviceId]/line1" with message body "test", for example using mosquitto_pub:

```
mosquitto_pub -h [mqttserver] -p 1883 -t cmnd/b5cfb5cfb5cfb5cfb5cfb5cfb5cfb5cf/line1 -u [mqttuser] -P [mqttpass] -m "test"
```

When this message causes the first line of your ANAVI Thermometer display to change to "test", OTA updates should be supported.
If not (after double checking that you used the correct topic and deviceId), please first update to a more recent firmware version.

(To reset the line again to the default display, just send an empty message to the same topic).

## Enabling OTA upgrades
For security reasons, OTA upgrades are disabled by default. There are two ways to enable them: either enter an IP address or domain name on the captive portal screen (see Chapter 2), or edit the official source code and define OTA_SERVER as explained in the comment. (You can even do both, if you want the Thermometer to accept upgrades from two sources.)

The web server can be located anywhere, but for improved security it is best if it is located on your local network, and no untrusted persons should be able to edit any files at all on the server. Don't host your firmware images on a shared server!

## Build binary firmware image

Using the arduino build setting above, instead of clicking Upload (Ctrl+U), use Menu Sketch -> Export compiled binary (CTRL+ALT+S). A .bin file will be created in the same folder as the .ino file.
Copy this file to the HTTP webserver you specified when you enabled OTA upgrades.

## Trigger update
The devices listens to MQTT messages in topic "cmnd/[deviceid]/update" and expects messages to be in the format

```
{"file":"/[filePath]", "server": "[server IP or DNS name]"}
```

For example, if you put the file at http://192.168.100.46/anavi.bin:

```
{"file":"/anavi.bin", "server": "192.168.100.46"}
```

If your server does not listen on port 80, you can provide the port, for example for  http://192.168.100.46:8080/anavi.bin:

```
{"file":"/anavi.bin", "server": "192.168.100.46", "port": 8080}
```

Example for sending an update message using mosquitto_pub:

```
mosquitto_pub -h [mqttserver] -p 1883 -t cmnd/b5cfb5cfb5cfb5cfb5cfb5cfb5cfb5cf/update -u [mqttuser] -P [mqttpass] -m "{\"file\":\"anavi.bin\", \"server\":\"192.168.100.46\", \"port\":8080}
```
***Note: To ensure successful update, please specify the file with leading slash ('/'), use an HTTP web server, not HTTPS, and -- when run from the command line -- escape quote characters***

On receipt of this message, ANAVI Thermometer will download the file from the specified server, update the firmware and restart. As with the normal firmware update, your saved settings such as WiFi and MQTT server settings should remain as configured.

***Note: After the update, you may find that readings from the DHT22 sensor no longer work and temperature and humidity are shown as "0". In this case, please powercycle the device (unplug power until display turns off, then plug power in again)***

## Using signed builds

If you do OTA upgrades, and especially if you do so over the Internet, you are strongly encouraged to use [Signed Updates](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/2.5.0/ota_updates/readme.html#advanced-security-signed-updates). Follow the link to see all the details.

If you are running the Arduino IDE on Linux or Mac it is very easy to enable automatic signing.  Just run these commands in the sketch directory:

```
openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048
openssl rsa -in private.key -outform PEM -pubout -out public.key
```

Once this is done, builds will be automatically signed.  In addition to the .bin file, a .bin.signed file will also be created.  You should see messages similar to these when you compile your sketch:

```
Enabling binary signing
Signed binary: /tmp/arduino_build_710055/sketch_apr03a.ino.bin.signed
```

The exact file name will change depending on your installation. Use the signed binary instead of the .bin file. Once you have upgraded your ANAVI Thermometer using a signed build, OTA upgrades will reject any attempt to use an unsigned build, a build signed using the wrong key, or a build that has been tampered with. (If necessary, you can still load an unsigned firmware using the USB to UART module, and then you will be able to use unsigned builds for OTA upgrades as well.)

Be sure the back up the private.key file, and make sure nobody can get hold of it.

# CHAPTER 4: Temperature scale: Celsius vs Fahrenheit

The temperature scale of the default open source firmware of ANAVI Thermometer can be configured at the initial setup of the device. By default it is set to Celsius. Manually type in **fahrenheit** to change it.

After the initial setup the temperature scale can be still changed with a single MQTT message with topic **cmnd/machine-id/tempformat** (where **machine-id** must be replaced with the
unique value for your board) and a JSON payload:

```
{ "scale": "fahrenheit" }
```

To switch back to Celsius, send the same message and just edit the JSON payload by changing **fahrenheit** to **celsius**.

For example, if using the mosquitto_pub application from a command-line terminal and machine id 11111111111111111111111111111111:

```
mosquitto_pub -h iot.eclipse.org -d -p 1883 -t
"cmnd/11111111111111111111111111111111/tempformat" -m '{ "scale":
"fahrenheit" }'
```

# CHAPTER 5: Home Automation Platforms

This chapter provide guidelines how to connect ANAVI Thermometer to popular home automation platforms like Home Assistant, OpenHab 2, Thinkspeak, etc.

## Home Assistant

[Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) is a free and open-source home automation platform running on Python 3 with more than 1200 components for integration with popular Internet of Things.

ANAVI Thermometer can be easily integrated in Home Assistant using the component [MQTT sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.mqtt/). This component supports JSON in the payload of the MQTT messages. To use it, in **configuration.yaml** specify MQTT broker and register the sensor with the corresponding MQTT topic, for example:

* Configure MQTT broker:

```
mqtt:
  broker: 127.0.0.1
```

* Register the MQTT sensor:

```
sensor:
    - platform: mqtt
      name: "Temperature"
      unit_of_measurement: 'C'
      state_topic: "home/room/temperature"
      value_template: "{{value_json.temperature}}"
    - platform: mqtt
      name: "Humidity"
      unit_of_measurement: '%'
      state_topic: "home/room/humidity"
      value_template: "{{value_json.humidity}}"
```

MQTT Discovery can simplify this process.  To use this, specify this in **configuration.yaml**:

```
mqtt:
  broker: 127.0.0.1
  discovery: true
  discovery_prefix: homeassistant
```

Also, supply a **Sensor name for Home Assistant** on the captive portal page of the ANAVI Thermometer. Sensors will automatically be created for the temperature, humidity, and (if connected) the DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor module.

The other sensors do not yet support MQTT Discovery.

## OpenHAB 2

[OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org/) is a popular free and open source home automation software. Major version 2 of OpenHAB is significantly different for version 1. It is written in the JAVA programming language using the Eclipse Smart Home framework. Version 2.4 of OpenHAB adds several [new MQTT features](https://www.openhab.org/blog/2018-12-16-mqtt-arrives-in-the-modern-openhab-2-x-architecture.html). [This YouTube video explains the exact steps how to integrate ANAVI Thermometer in OpenHAB 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjuXcqKG1Kc).

Follow the steps below to integrate ANAVI Thermometer in OpenHAB 2:

### OpenHAB Step 1: Install MQTT Binding

Open the **Paper UI** web interface of OpenHAB 2. Go to **Add-ons > Binding**. Find **MQTT Binding** and click **Install**

### OpenHAB Step 2: Configure MQTT Broker

Again in Paper UI of OpenHAB 2, go to **Configuration > Things**. Click the button to add a new thing. Select **MQTT Thing Binding**. After that click **ADD MANUALLY**. Click **MQTT Broker**. Enter the domain or the IP address of the MQTT broker, the port and any other needed credentials.

After adding the MQTT Broker to OpenHAB go to **Configuration > Things** and verify that the broker appears as online. If it is not online double check the configuration and try again.

### OpenHAB Step 3: Install JavaScript Transformations

Go to **Add-ons > Transformations**. Find **JavaScript Transformation** and click **Install**

### OpenHAB Step 4: Download JavaScript Files

Download [**temperature.js** and **humidity.js** from GitHub](https://github.com/AnaviTechnology/anavi-examples/tree/master/openhab2/transform) and deploy both files in directory **$OPENHAB_CONF/transform**.

For example, on Raspberry Pi with OpenHABian variable **$OPENHAB_CONF** is set to **/etc/openhab2** so the whole path is **/etc/openhab2/transform**:

```
cd $OPENHAB_CONF/transform
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnaviTechnology/anavi-examples/master/openhab2/transform/temperature.js
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnaviTechnology/anavi-examples/master/openhab2/transform/humidity.js
```

**Note**: If you prefer the temperature in Fahrenheit, set variable **celsius** to **false** in the first line of **temperature.js**. This way the JavaScript will automatically convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit when showing it in the user interfaces of OpenHAB.

### OpenHAB Step 5: Add ANAVI Thermometer as MQTT Generic Thing

In **Paper UI** web interface go to **Configuration > Things**. Click the button to add a new thing and select **MQTT Thing Binding**.

On the next screen it is very important to click **ADD MANUALLY**. After that select **Generic MQTT Thing**. Set the name, for example to **ANAVI Thermometer**. Set the MQTT broker configured on step 2 for **Bridge Selection**.

After creating the **Generic MQTT Thing**, open it and add two channels:

* A channel with type **Text value**, label **Temperature** and **Incoming value transformation** set to **JS:temperature.js**. Set the **MQTT State Topic** to **\<workgroup>/\<machine id>/air/temperature** (replace **\<workgroup>** and **\<machine id>** with the actual values)

* A channel with type **Text value**, label **Humidity** and **Incoming value transformation** set to **JS:humidity.js**. Set the **MQTT State Topic** to **\<workgroup>/\<machine id>/air/humidity** (replace **\<workgroup>** and **\<machine id>** with the actual values)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** In both topics replace **\<workgroup>** and **\<machine id>** with valid values! You have set **\<workgroup>** during the initial configuration of ANAVI Thermometer, the default value is **workgroup**. The **\<machine id>** is MD5 hash generated based on the ESP8266 chip ID of ANAVI Thermometer. The machine ID is displayed in the web interface during the initial configuration of ANAVI Thermometer. It is also printed it serial console output on each boot of ANAVI Thermometer therefore you can also see it through Arduino IDE.

Finally, **Link channel** to the default profile of a new item. As [shown in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjuXcqKG1Kc) this has to be done for both the temperature and the humidity.

If everything works fine you will see the temperature and the humidity reported from **ANAVI Thermometer** in the **Control** section of **Paper UI** as well as in the **Basic UI** of OpenHAB 2 (and newer).

## I2C

The sensors that can be connected to ANAVI Thermometer communicate with a host microcontroller via a communications standard called **I2C** (Inter-Integrated-Circut). I2C uses two wires, labelled SDA (Serial Data) and SCL (Serial Clock). To function properly, I2C requires a pullup resistor on each of those lines therefore ANAVI Thermometer includes two 4.7kohm resistors labelled as R2 and R3. If for one reason or another you need to disable the I2C pullup resistors remove R2 and R3.
